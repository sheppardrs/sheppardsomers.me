  <h1 class="PageHeader">Finding Something!</h1>
  <h2>Looking for something?</h2>
  <p>Post an ask for something you or your loved ones are looking for. It could be anything from a winter
    coat to a new phone. Tell people what your story is, why you need something, and how it will make a difference
    to you.</p>
  <h2><a href="#">Complete an Inquiry</a></h2>
  <p>Be sure to first complete a profile so that the community can learn about you,
    then complete an ask demonstrating your situation, what item will help you, and
    what impact the item will have for you. If you do match and receive what you
    were looking for, be sure to send out a thank you notification.
  </p>
  <h2>Some pointers</h2>
  <p>Be personal in your presentation. Demonstrate how this
    situation has come about and how what you are asking for will
    help tackle the challenge in your life. Make tangible statements
    about the difference the item will make to you or your family.
    Frame this story of impact as an individual; we are wired to
    connect more with an individual and their endeavors than we are
    with a group. Similarly if this is a single instance and not a chronic
    need then mention that. If it is a chronic problem then perhaps address
    and how this may be different. If you do have a chronic need though, then
    there may be bettter resources available for you. Be truthful in your requests.
    Be sure to select the tags that best match you, your request, or your situation.
    We use the tags to match people and to filter searches.
  </p>
  <p>If you would like to learn more about these suggestions and the research
    that they stem from, head over to our <a href="SharityResearch.html">research</a>
    page and learn more about the science between asking, giving, and finding
    assistance.
