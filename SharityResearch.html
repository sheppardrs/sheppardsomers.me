  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>A good ask often centers around one person, who has been clearly identified, with a specific
    request and specific information about the impact that the item will have. It is often helpful to imagine
    a time that you gave, whether on Sharity or otherwise, when sharing your story. Avoid being overly emotional, but also don't
    hide your emotions. Be true to what is going on in your life and what you need. An authentic
    story is much more likely to find a pairing. </p>
  <h2>Research</h2>
  <p>In creating this platform we read many academic articles that centered specifically
    around how an ask can generate a response. Some of our favorite and most enlightening articles are summarized
    below along with a link to the article's text where applicable.</p>

        Compassion fade: Affect and charity are greatest for a single child in need</a>
        <p>The number of victims, identifiability of the victims, and proportion of victims helped are all
          inversely proportional to the compassion shown to victims by donors. This means that fewer, clearly identified victims who
           the donor can help the largest portion, receive the largest donations in a typical charitable donation request. Part of this
           is because of the identifiable victim which is that people are much more willing to help one person rather
          than many because one person is viewed as a coherent unit which <q>leads to more extensive
          processing of information and stronger impressions about individuals than about groups.</q> (INCLUDE PAGE NUMBER FOR THIS QUOTE)
          Which is to say that we humans have stronger emotional reactions to a single person's situation
          since it is easier for the emotional side of our brain to process. Larger groups of victims get pushed
          to the quantitative and logical side of our brain and are dealt with as numbers rather than people with stories. </p>

          </a>
          <p>Donors give more when they can help 40 out of 50 rather than 80 out of 400.
            This is known as Perceived Utility. It is most affected by the proportion
            that we see our donation helping; the higher the proportion, the higher the
            donations. This is tied to the Identifiable Victim Effect, which in turn
            is tied to vividness. In ex post cases (a case where the victim already exists)
            more donations will be
            illicited for a specific, yet unidentified victim. Further, we are more
            likely to help someone who has experienced a loss not a chronic
            state. (Reference-dependence effect; Small 2010). Also on a more expected note, people are
            more likely to help sad looking children rather than happy looking children.

              One of us: Outstanding willingness to help save a single identified compatriot</a>
          <p>The Identifiable Victim Effect is mainly limited to the in-group of the donor.
              It is present for domestic donations but not as present for international donations.
              Groups in the out group also receive similar donations as individuals,
              and the out-groups unidentified victims actually receive more donations
              than the identified ones. This comes from an experiment with Israeli subjects
              that referred to rescueing an Israeli person or Indian person from a Tsunami
              on an Indian island. The when an Israeli subject was asked about their donation
              to saving an Indian national, the amount was actually more for an unidentified victim
              than an identified one. This contradicts the Identifiable Victim Effect, which was
              still present when the Israeli subject was asked about saving an Israeli national.
              So the identifiable victim effect is only present when both the giver and the recipient
              are in the same "group" (though it is unclear how broad the definition of group here must
              be to mitigate the effect).

              Unit Asking A Method to Boost Donations and Beyond</a>
              <p>The Unit Asking Method is executed by asking the donor to state the
                amount that they would donate for one unit, normally one person in
                situation X, and then asking them how much they want to give to the
                total issue. This works because the donor psychologically is affected
                by the desire for consistency and therefore donates more. It also
                helps to combat scope insensitivity, which is how generally we
                simply ignore a number, especially emotionally, since we cannot
                comprehend or process the number on an emotional level, as mentioned above.
                One key of this technique is that the donor must write down the single unit
                donation number in order for there to be a significant increase (2.5x)
                in the total donation. Just thinking about the unit donation also increases
                the donation though not significantly.

              Increasing Contributions in Solicitation Campaigns: The Use of Large and Small Anchorpoints</a>
            <p>This article studied how asking for a large donation or welcoming small donations
              affects donation size and participation rates.
              Asking for a somewhat large donation, increases the average donation amount while
              not affecting (in a statistically significant manner) the participation rate.
              Conversely, adding a phrase such as “even a penny would help” increases the
              participation rate significantly, but does not (statistically significantly) affect donation
              size. Using both in the same request mutes the effect of both, but
              creates a better response than using neither. The asking for a larger amount
              was the most effective ($11 avg v. $4 control) for an average of 1.25/participant v. .4 /participant.

              I&#39m Moral, but I Won&#39t Help You: The Distinct Roles of Empathy and Justice in Donations</a>
              <p>
                This article talks about dealing with percieved fault and donations. It also investigated
                how to manipulate the donor’s thoughts on whose fault an event is. It finds that
                morals are a good indicator of charitable giving and a good motivator for it. But
                a strong moral system also corresponds to decreased donations in situations where
                the recipient is perceived to be responsible. This effect can be alleviated by
                pointing out to the donor their own previous misgivings. This means that moral
                “identity” does not always increase charitable giving, but can limit it
                when responsibility is perceived to be on the recipient. They also investigate
                how this effect can be dissected and assigned to the roles that empathy and
                justice play in the donor’s decision. Justice limits decisions where it is
                perceived to be the recipient’s own fault, meanwhile empathy is the leading
                factor when it is not perceived to be the victim's fault.

              <q>Why didn&#39t you just ask?</q> Underestimating the discomfort of help-seeking</a>
              <p>As many of us know from experience, us people find asking for help uncomfortable.
                This study investigated how aware we are of someone&#39s discomfort in an asking situation.
                It turns out that people who have been primed to be a <q>help-seeker</q> are more aware of the
                discomfort than people primed for the helper role. The subjects in this study
                were primed by asking them to write a paragraph about a time they helped someone
                or a time that they had to ask for assistance. The study goes on to find that
                the best way to urge people to ask for help is to address how they may feel
                uncomfortable asking for help. It is not effective to stress the practical
                use of the help. So telling people that you know it may be uncomfortable,
                but utilizing help doesn’t need to be embarrassing. E.g. saying <q>Receiving mentorship
                can feel a bit awkward when you are trying to get off to a good start. I hope
                that you will come to me for any guidance you might need without being concerned
                about appearing foolish or incompetent.</q> is better than saying <q>Mentorship
                can be an invaluable resource when you are trying to get off to a good start.
                I hope that you will come to me for any guidance that you might need so that
                you can be productive and successful in your new role.</q>

              Dispositional differences in seeking autonomy- or dependency-oriented help: conceptual development and scale validation.</a>
              <p>
                This article explores to motivations or goals behind people's asking for help. They
                are asking for help to fix the problem or to learn how to fix the problem.
                They are termed dependency-oriented and autonomy-oriented. Dependency-oriented
                help is like asking for the fish in the popular proverb, <q>Give a man a fish,
                feed him for a day, teach a man to fish, feed him for a lifetime.</q> Autonomy,
                on the other hand, is asking how to fish. Autonomy is associated with mastery
                goals and dependency is associated with avoidance temperament and performance
                avoidance goal orientation. Dependency styled folks may be more concerned with
                failure and therefore rely on the expert opinion/solution, while Autonomy styled
                folks may be more focused on the method and new methods. There is also the
                avoidant type which just avoids asking for help. Fun fact: the cross-cultural
                aspect of the study found that Russians are rarely the avoidance type.

              The semantics of asking a favor: Asking for help in three countries</a>

                Orientation of request: How you ask, either through sympathy or duty. Then the
                legitimacy of the request is the next part of the ask that is explored by this
                study. So it is a 2x2 of sympathy or duty against legitimate or illegitimate
                requests. The legitimacy of a request does not matter too much for a duty
                request, since the focus is on the helper not the helped. In the sympathy,
                or victim oriented, ask, the legitimacy is very important in the US and somewhat
                important in Britain and Australia. The legitimacy of a duty, or target
                oriented, made no impact in Britain and Australia, but made a 10% difference
                in the US. Britsih people were the most likely to help with the favor of mailing the
                package, the Americans were least likely to help. This is perhaps influenced
                by the perception that a stranger approaching you has in each country.
                In the US people may be more wary to begin with and that could explain
                why they are more sensitive to the legitimacy of the request.

              Charitable technologies: opportunities for collaborative computing in nonprofit fundraising</a>
              <p>
                This article is almost a decade old; it's from 2008, so it's not super recent.
                It talks about how technology was being used at the time by nonprofits.
              </p>
                As many of us know, online donation gathering is favored by younger generations.
                It is also much cheaper to gather donations online than it is offline for the
                nonprofits. The article notes, in the introduction, that you want to gather
                donors -- not funds. You want to build a community of donors who care about
                the cause. Data about each charity and its success is important to websites
                that rank and rate charities. It is hard for the single situation charities
                to maintain a personal relationship with donors, i.e. for kickstarter projects,
                but they can build a group of members who each support multiple projects
                instead. Then the charity can count on word of mouth and recommendations to
                build their base. This is effective because most people discover and trust
                a charity because of their friends' and family's recommendations. The article
                actually suggest that computing and the web expand into used goods donations,
                just as Sharity aims to do.

              Storytelling with Data: Examining the Use of Data by Non-Profit Organizations</a>
              <p>
                This article addresses how non-profit organizations (NPOs) utilize public data
                (big data) in their operations. The authors have their own portal that
                they have created to assist NPOs with data mining, processing and
                visualization. They found that most of the NPOs that used their portal
                were most interested in using the data scientists that were provided to
                find the useful data for them. (They were not interested in the raw
                data as it is presented by the government.)
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to offering the portal they performed a qualitative study
                of 15 employees at 10 NPOs. The interviews were partially structured
                and investigated the use of open data by the NPOs. They found that NPOs generally
                use open data to narrate stories to their donors and stakeholders.
                Hetorogeneous datasets are when a NPO uses multiple data sets and
                pieces of data to compile one story. Homogeneous datasets are datasets
                that by themselve can tell multiple stories. Both of these types of datasets
                are used by NPOs in creating two different styles of narratives.

              <p>
                This study by Bella M. DePAULO and Jeffrey D. Fisher investigated what
                people consider when deciding to ask for help. It specifically focused on
                whether eople take into account the cost to themself as well as the cost
                to the helper when deciding whether to ask for help or not. It finds that
                indeed people do consider both the cost to themself (in terms of recognition,
                pride, etc.), but also the cost to the potential helper (their time, energy,
                etc.). Further, the study finds that people are less likely to ask for
                help if they cannot repay the helper, but this may contradict information
                presented in a separate study. So the perceived cost to the helper is an
                important item in any help-seeking interaction.
