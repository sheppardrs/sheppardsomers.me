  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>A good ask often centers around one person, who has been clearly identified, with a specific
    request and specific information about the impact that the item will have. It is often helpful to imagine
    a time that you gave, whether on Sharity or otherwise, when sharing your story. Avoid being overly emotional, but also don't
    hide your emotions. Be true to what is going on in your life and what you need. An authentic
    story is much more likely to find a pairing. </p>
  <h2>Research</h2>
  <p>In creating this platform we read many academic articles that centered specifically
    around how an ask can generate a response. Some of our favorite and most enlightening articles are summarized
    below along with a link to the article's text where applicable.</p>
