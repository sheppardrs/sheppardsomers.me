  <h1 class="PageHeader">Support our Mission!</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>As Sharity is still in its development stage, we welcome any assistance that
  you may offer, especially in terms of experience. We are also accepting financial
  backing to help get Sharity off the ground. In the future, giving financially to
  Sharity will help support our business costs, but most importantly can help fund
  shipping for matches that are made on our platform.
  </p>
  <h2>Future Financial Gifts</h2>
  <p>It is our hope that financial support for Sharity can help fuel and realize
    the connections made on our platform. Naturally this would involve general
    cost of maintenance, but we hope to implement a shipping sponsorship so that
    no connection is wasted. This would involve certain matches being eligible to
    receive free shipping when neither party is in a position to comfortably fund
    any necessary shipping.
  </p>
  <h2>Current Support</h2>
  <p>Since Sharity is still growing out of the idea phase, we welcome any support
    be it in development, legal, or financial. If you are interested in becoming involved
    in any aspect, or just would like to know more about our mission and our methods
    please do not hesitate to reach out to: ##################
