  <h1 class="PageHeader">How Giving Happens!</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>When you find yourself with something you no longer need or have some extras
    of, Sharity can help you find someone for whom the item will make difference.
    It is not required, but it is helpful for the community, for you to complete a
    profile before giving. This way when you connect with someone they will know
    a little bit about where you came from. Who knows, maybe you will have some
    shared experiences that you can later discuss, some advice to share, or a
    friendship to form.
  </p>
  <p>Below you can search by different tags, categories, directly search by item,
    geographic location, or allow us to give you some curated suggestions. After you
    choose how to browse the many stories out there, you will have the opportunity
    to learn more about each person and the impact that you could have on their
    life, by giving them the item you are disposing of. You'll see the impact
    upfront, meaning you'll know exactly what difference you are making before
    you even donate!
  </p>
